### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am very interested in Cybersecurity and like programming. I needed a place to share my solutions for Advent of Code so that's why I am here. Take a look at my website/blog where I publish write-ups for CTF's, rooms on HTB/THM/OTW etc. and what else crosses my mind. I also like solving challenges on Codewars: https://www.codewars.com/users/dropberry. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying computer science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to become the greatest hacker in the world.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: on reddit u/dropberry
- :coffee: Fun fact: I like cacao (a lot) more than coffee.
